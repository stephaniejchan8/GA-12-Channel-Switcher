# GA-12-Channel-Switcher
General Assembly JS exercise to use conditionals to create channel switcher. 
Although I think it would have been better to use loops, I tried not to use loops as this exercise was given before loops were taught in the course.

In my 2nd commit, I made a revision of my HTML and JS code to improve accessibility by including keyboard event listeners and made channel buttons focusable. I also tried to tidy up my code so that it is neater.
